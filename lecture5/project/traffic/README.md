# My experience constructing the neural network for this assignment - Tim

My solution is clearly not optimal, but I got a sense of what's bad practice and what not to do during my experimentation. I tried many other values for the number of nodes in the hidden layer, but 128 is by far the best one I have tested out.

In conclusion, values that are either too large or too small would not be ideal, in addition, if there are too many hidden layers regardless of their number of nodes or activation functions, the accuracy is going to decrease.
